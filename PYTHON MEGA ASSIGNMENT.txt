largest = 0

if a > b and a > c:
    largest = a
if b > a and b > c:
    largest = b
if c > a and c > b:
    largest = c

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

-Strings are sequences of characters. Your name can be considered a string. Or, say you live in Zambia, then your country name is "Zambia", which is a string.
-To create a string, put the sequence of characters inside either single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes and then assign it to a variable.

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

- Individual characters in a string can be accessed by specifying the string name followed by a number in square brackets ( [] ). String indexing in Python is zero-based: the first character in the string has index 0 , the next has index 1 , and so on.

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
```
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"
```

my_str = 'Big Data iNeuron'
print(my_str[-7:])

```

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[:-8:-1])

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[::-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
-Python will not allow deleting a particular character in a string. Whereas you can remove the entire string variable using the del command

Q32. What is escape sequence?

- An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters

Q33. How can you print the below string?
```
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

```
print(" 'iNeuron's Big Data Course' ")

Q34. What is a list in Python?
- List. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
- In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
- The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as the syntax for accessing the characters of a string. We use the index operator ( [] – not to be confused with an empty list). The expression inside the brackets specifies the index

Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
```
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
``` 

my_list = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(my_list[4][2])

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.

# creating an empty list
lst = []
  
# number of elements as input
n = int(input("Enter number of elements : "))
  
# iterating till the range
for i in range(0, n):
    ele = int(input())
  
    lst.append(ele) # adding the element
      
print(lst)

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
```
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

```
lis = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lis.insert(2, "Big")
print(lis)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
 - Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable, The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
- A tuple in Python can be created by enclosing all the comma-separated elements inside the parenthesis ()

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
- my_tuple = ("ranjith")
print(my_tuple) - yes we are able to add tuple to the value

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
- You can't add elements to a tuple because of their immutable property

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
- tuple1, tuple2 = (123, 'xyz', 'zara')
print "First tuple length : ", len(tuple1)

Q45. What are sets in Python?
- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable

Q46. How can you create a set?

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
-nameSet = {"John", "Jane", "Doe"}
-nameSet.add("iNeuron")

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
- To append a multiple values to a list, we can use the built-in extend() method in Python

Q49. How is update() different from add()?

- add() function add a single element to the set, whereas update() function iterates over the given sequences and adds them to the set

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
- The clear() method removes all elements from the set

Q51. What is frozen set?
- Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function. As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
- Frozenset is similar to set in Python, except that frozensets are immutable, which implies that once generated, elements from the frozenset cannot be added or removed. This function accepts any iterable object as input and transforms it into an immutable object.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
- Union of two given sets is the smallest set which contains all the elements of both the sets

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
- The intersection of sets can be denoted using the symbol '∩'. As defined above, the intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are common to both A and B

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?
- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
- A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value. When presented with a key the dictionary will • A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

- Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-Value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
- Dict = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
print(Dict) 

Q58. What will the output of the following?
```
var = {}
print(type(var))

- <class 'dict'>
```

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

- There is no add() , append() , or insert() method you can use to add an item to a dictionary in Python. Instead, you add an item to a dictionary by inserting a new index key into the dictionary, then assigning it a particular value

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.

# Creating a Dictionary
Dict = {1: 'Geeks', 'name': 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
  
# accessing a element using key
print("Accessing a element using key:")
print(Dict['name'])

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.

people = {1: {'name': 'John', 'age': '27', 'sex': 'Male'},
          2: {'name': 'Marie', 'age': '22', 'sex': 'Female'}}

print(people[1]['name'])
print(people[1]['age'])
print(people[1]['sex'])

Q62. What is the use of get() function?

- Python find() function is used to return the lowest index value of the first occurrence of the substring from the input string; else it returns -1

Q63. What is the use of items() function?
- The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
- The pop() method removes the element at the specified position.

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
- The popitem() method removes the item that was last inserted into the dictionary

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
- The keys() method in Python Dictionary, returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary in order of insertion using Python

Q67. What is the use of values() function?
- values() is an inbuilt method in Python programming language that returns a view object.

Q68. What are loops in Python?
- Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
- There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
- For loop is used when the number of iterations is already known. While loop is used when the number of iterations is already Unknown

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
- The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
- Break' in Python is a loop control statement. It is used to control the sequence of the loop. Suppose you want to terminate a loop and skip to the next code after the loop; break will help you do that

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
- The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
- The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
- You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
